### Installation

**It's doesn't care about the operating system, as long as it can run docker & docker-compose, should be fine! tested in Ubuntu 18.04**

- clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/j-speers/Docker-MMO.git
```

- edit docker-compose.yaml, change `{PUBLIC_IP}` with your server public IP

```
    ports:
    - "{PUBLIC_IP}:29000:29000"
```

- run all services

```
make up-perfectworld
```

### Future Feature

currently, it's not support `pwAdmin` since `pwAdmin` required modifiying & executing to each subsystems. This is not possible in microservices, since we are running each subsystems in different container.

### Troubleshooting

#### Server Network Error

try to restart authd container by running this command

```
docker stop perfectworld-authd
docker start perfectworld-authd
```
